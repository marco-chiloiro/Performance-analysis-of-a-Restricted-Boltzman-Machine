# Performance-analysis-of-a-Restricted-Boltzman-Machine
Results of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) applied on a binary
dataset. This machine is an artificial neural network capable of generating new data according to
the given input. The probability distribution of the data is not known to the algorithm. Thanks to
auxiliary ’hidden’ units, the model allows to recognize the correlations between the variables and
recreating data according to the unknown pdf. We analyzed the performance of our machine while
changing the parameters of the training procedure. Different methods are proposed to verify the
quality of the training and generated dataset.
